# Image Filter

This program reads in an image file and outputs the associated image filter applied to it. The available filters for images are:

1. mirror: flips the image about the y-axis
2. grey: greys out the colours of the pixels
3. invert: swaps the max and min values of pixels resulting in colour change of image
4. compress: compresses dimensions of the image given

Refer to the ImageFilterTest class to run visual representations of image filters applied to the "tree.png" image.
